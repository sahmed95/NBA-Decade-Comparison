# NBA-Decade-Comparison
This project uses Principal component analysis (PCA) as a foundation to explore characterization
of basketball player performance data in two phases. We find useful feature spaces within traditionally
tracked ”box-score” statistics under the assumption that these feature spaces might be useful in
predicting future player performances. After conducting PCA, the project shifts to machine learning techniques with the aim of predicting player characteristics, namely, the decade played in and the listed position. We use Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) and Naive Bayes Classification to classify these characteristics. In the second phase, we investigate the feature space to potentially predict an ”advanced statistic” of Win Shares which is associated with an individual player’s contribution to a team’s success. We use a logistic regression classifier to achieve marginal success in predicting the most recent decade of Win Shares statistics using 1990s decade data.
